## Introduction

Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that enables developers to create powerful web applications and APIs with minimal overhead. This repository includes multiple demo projects illustrating best practices for developing backend services and interactive web applications using Flask.

## Features
- REST API development examples
- Web application development examples
- Modular code structure
- Environment-specific configurations
- Error handling and validation
- Template rendering with Jinja2 (for web apps)

## Getting Started

Would you like me to also help you write a *short sample `requirements.txt`* to go with it? ðŸš€ (Itâ€™s usually simple for demo apps!)
